Just a basic a copy of Facebook I had used to understand website building and databases.(front end, backend, deployment, API, firebase, supabase.)
in this website you can create/login your account, post and find friends aswell as messege them. I had also intergrated a map API for the basketball map.
after I had finished garnering new users i decided on switching from firebase to supabase to understand how to migrate. 
this project is a throw away, used for me to just understand the basics of website building and advertising. I am proactively applying my new found skills to my new projects.
